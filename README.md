# hacklytics25

Welcome to our Hacklytics project! This datathon had five different tracks - finance, cyber, sports, healthcare, and gen AI. Our team decided to do finance and make a dinosaur-themed stock analysis tool, taking inspiration from the event's Jurassic theme.

This is our main page:

On this page, a user is able to input a stock ticker into the input box. They can then click on one of the four dinosaurs which will bring them to a different stock analysis tool.

Here is an example of the "Trend-O-Dactyl" page (intended to illustrate a stock's trends and behaviors):

Stock-O-Saurus was made with a React frontend using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This was then integrated with a python backend using MyPlotLib for the graphs and statistical analysis for the functions.
